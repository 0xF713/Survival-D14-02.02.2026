***SUCCESS!***

From the Developers: 

Hello, traveler! We invite you to play a game - one inspired by the classic text-based adventure quests with a touch of puzzle-solving. 

Each Task is a new challenge, an obstacle you need to overcome. \
Only those who complete them all can move forward.

***PRESS ANY KEY TO CONTINUE…***

### Our Recommendations
How to learn at School 21:  
- Throughout the course, you'll be finding information on your own. Use every reliable source you can-Google, GigaChat, etc. Be critical about sources: verify, think, analyze, compare.
- Peer-to-peer (P2P) learning means learners share knowledge and experience, acting as both mentors and students. You learn not only from instructors but also from your peers, which leads to deeper understanding.
- Don't hesitate to ask for help: the peers around you are on the same path. And don't be afraid to respond when others ask for help. Your experience is valuable-share it.
- Don't copy. If you do get help, make sure you fully understand why, how, and what for. Otherwise the learning won't stick.
- If you're stuck, feel like you've tried everything, and still don't see the next step-take a break. This simple trick has saved many developers: get some air, reset your head, and the solution may come next time you try.
- The outcome matters, but so does the process. Don't just solve the task-understand how to solve it.
- Manage your time while working on the project. Aim to complete at least one challenge per day.
- After submission, every project goes through several checks: peer-review via a checklist, automated tests, code style checks, static analysis, and memory-safety checks.

How to work on the project: 
- You can find useful video materials in the Projects (Media) section on the Platform.
- Before you start, clone the project from GitLab into a repository with the same name.
- All source code files must be created inside the src/ directory of the cloned repository.
- After cloning the project, create a branch named develop and do all your work there. When you push your progress to GitLab, make sure you push the develop branch.

## Level 1. Room 1

![level1_room1](misc/rus/images/level1_room1.png)

***LOADING Level 1…***

***LOADING Room 1…***

\> *Look around*

You're in an unfamiliar room. In front of you is a small desk with an old IBM PC-compatible computer. On the desk - a Pixar-style desk lamp casting a warm, cozy light, a few yellowed sheets of paper, and a cup of hot coffee. \
Across from you is a closed door. It seems to have an electronic lock - there's no handle or keyhole.
 
\> *Pull the door*

No handle. Nothing to pull.

\> *Kick the door*

Ouch. That didn't help.

\> *Sit at the desk*

You sit down at the desk. Now what? \
At least this doesn't hurt.

\> *Take a sip of coffee*

Actually, not bad at all!

\> *Take a sip of coffee*

Actually, not bad at all!

\> *Take a sip of coffee*

Actually, not bad at all!

![day1_coffee](misc/images/rus/day1_coffee.png)

\> *Take a sip of coffee*

The coffee's gone.

\> *Look at the desk*

Sheets of paper. Nothing unusual. Lots of text. \
One sheet has very little written on it - that's what catches your eye:

>***"Turn on the computer."***

\> *Turn on the computer*

You don't have to look long for the power switch - it's a big analog lever. The machine hums to life and shows a screen with a blinking cursor.

\> *Look for a mouse*

No mouse.

\> *Look for windows*

No windows. Only the door. And none on the screen either...

\> *Press Enter*

The cursor moves to the next line.

\> *Wait*

Nothing happens.

\> *Wait*

Still nothing.

\> *Look at the desk*

Sheets of paper. Nothing unusual. Lots of text. \
Under the one you read, there are others.

\> *Read the papers.*

## Chapter II
## List 1

>The story of Linux began in 1991, when a Finnish graduate student and programmer named Linus Torvalds started developing an operating system kernel for his personal computer. 
>
>He uploaded his work to a public server - a move that became a turning point in Linux history. At first, dozens, then hundreds, and later thousands of developers joined his effort. Together, they created a full-fledged operating system.
>
>Linux was heavily influenced by Unix - even its name reflects that. The first official version, Linux 1.0, was released in 1994. From the very beginning and to this day, Linux has been distributed as free software under the GPL license. This means that the source code of the operating system is open to everyone - not only to view, but also to modify. The only requirement is that any modified code must remain accessible to all and be distributed under the same GPL license. This principle is crucial: it allows developers to use and build upon existing code without fear of copyright issues.

There's a large coffee stain across the rest of the page.

## List 2

The sheet looks like it's been chewed up by a printer - apparently a dot-matrix one.

>3. At first, Torvalds wanted to name his creation Freax - a blend of free, freak, and the letter X (symbolizing Unix systems). But the system administrator who gave him space on the server for distribution renamed the directory to Linux;
>4. It took a while to choose a logo, but eventually they settled on Tux the penguin. In his book Just for Fun, Torvalds explains that he chose a penguin as the emblem because, during a 1993 visit to an Australian zoo, he was once pecked by one;
>5. Linux is the undisputed champion in terms of installations among general-purpose operating systems. It runs practically everywhere: on every supercomputer from the world's Top-500 list, on Android phones, Chromebooks, all kinds of embedded devices, e-readers, smart TVs, and much more;
>6. The Linux kernel is written in the C programming language;
>7. The Linux kernel version 1.0.0 contained 176,250 lines of code. Today, it consists of more than 10 million lines;

## List 3

>Bourne shell (often abbreviated as sh, after the executable name) is an early UNIX command shell developed by Stephen Bourne at Bell Labs and released as part of the 7th Edition of the UNIX operating system in 1978. This shell became the de facto standard and is available in almost every \*nix distribution. 
>
>The name "bash" is an acronym for Bourne Again Shell - a play on words referring both to the Bourne shell and the phrase "born again." The Bourne shell (sh), created by Stephen Bourne, was improved and extended in 1987 by Brian Fox. The pun comes from the similarity between Bourne and the English word born, hence "the born-again shell."

## List 4

>Git is a distributed version control system created by Linus Torvalds to manage the development of the Linux kernel. The first version was released on April 7, 2005, and later its maintenance was handed over to Junio Hamano.
>
>Today, Git is the de facto standard among tools for collaborative software development. 
>
>It is free software, released under the GNU GPL v2 license, and by default uses TCP port 9418.
>
>Originally, Linux kernel development relied on a proprietary system called BitKeeper, created by Larry McVoy, himself a Linux developer, who had provided it to the project under a free license. When some developers - highly skilled programmers - wrote several utilities and Andrew Tridgell performed reverse engineering of BitKeeper's data transfer format, McVoy accused them of violating the agreement and revoked the license. In response, Torvalds began creating a new system: none of the available open-source tools at the time could support collaboration among thousands of developers (this same conflict also inspired the creation of Mercurial). The idea was simple - take the CVS approach, turn it upside down, and make it more reliable.
>
>The initial development took less than a week: work began on April 3, 2005, and by April 7, Git's own codebase was already being tracked by the still-unfinished system. On June 16, the Linux kernel was migrated to Git, and on July 25, Torvalds stepped down as Git's lead maintainer.
>
>Torvalds later joked about the project's name - git (British slang for "bastard"):  "I'm an egotistical bastard, so I name all my projects after myself. First Linux, now git."

## Chapter III
## Quests: Level 1. Room 1

## Quest 1. Clone

>The key to the door is in the repository, inside the /src folder. Run `git clone`.

That's the last sheet.

\> *Look at the screen again*

Still the same blinking cursor.

\> *git clone*

You must specify a repository to clone. 

    usage: git clone [<options>] [--] <repo> [<dir>]
        -v, --verbose         be more verbose
        -q, --quiet           be more quiet
        --progress            force progress reporting
        -n, --no-checkout     don't create a checkout
        --bare                create a bare repository
        --mirror              create a mirror repository (implies bare)
        -l, --local           to clone from a local repository
        --no-hardlinks        don't use local hardlinks, always copy
        -s, --shared          setup as shared repository
        --recursive           initialize submodules in the clone
        --recurse-submodules  initialize submodules in the clone
        --template <template-directory>     directory from which templates will be used
        --reference <repo>    reference repository
        --dissociate          use --reference only while cloning
        -o, --origin <name>   use <name> instead of 'origin' to track upstream
        -b, --branch <branch>    checkout <branch> instead of the remote's HEAD
        -u, --upload-pack <path>     path to git-upload-pack on the remote
        --depth <depth>       create a shallow clone of that depth
        --single-branch               clone only one branch, HEAD or --branch
        --separate-git-dir <gitdir>   separate git dir from working tree
        -c, --config <key=value>    set config inside the new repository

\> *Please enter your action...*

#### Quest 1 received: Clone the repository to your local terminal using the Git command-line client.

> Note: for successful cloning, make sure you have an SSH key configured for GitLab.

***LOADING…***

## Quest 2. Repo

\> *Look at the screen*

You're inside the repository folder. A blinking terminal cursor awaits your command.

\> *Go to /src*

You need to enter a terminal command...

\> *List files*

You need to enter a terminal command...

\> *Run ai_initial_module.sh*

Good idea. Maybe the AI can help you find a way out… Talk to it.

#### Quest 2 received: Run the script `src/ai_initial_module.sh` in bash and follow the instructions. Fix any errors if necessary (you are not allowed to modify the script itself). Commit all your changes to version control.

>Hint: The system expects exactly five modules for correct execution. You may need to use the `chmod` command to make scripts executable. Check if a file has execute permissions using the ls -l command.

>Note: In this and all subsequent quests, "commit your changes to version control" means adding files to the staging area, committing them, and pushing the changes to the remote repository.

***LOADING…***

## Quest 3. Dirs & Files

\> *Read the text in the terminal*

Lots of output. It seems that launching the modules triggers a chain reaction - different parts of the AI start connecting to one another, crashing, breaking, and cheerfully reporting it all to the terminal. It's hard to extract anything useful from that stream.

\> *Ask: "How do I get out of here?"*

Amid the chaos, you spot a line: "Try talking to `src/ai_door_management_module.sh`."

\> *Run `src/ai_door_management_module.sh`*

The module tries to read some configuration files for initialization and launch - apparently, it fails.

\> *Run again*

Good call! The most universal method. Use it often.

Unfortunately, it didn't help. And there's reason to believe it never will. Looks like you'll have to deal with the configuration file structure required for the module to run. 

**Tip**: Save all the commands you used for this in `quest3.sh`, place it inside the src/ folder, and don't forget to commit it to version control. You might need to revive this module again someday. The simplest way to add a line to a file is with the `echo` command and redirection. But you didn't hear that from me.

#### Quest 3 received: Fix the configuration files used by `src/ai_door_management_module.sh`. Correct any errors if needed. Record all commands in `src/quest3.sh`. Commit all changes to version control.

>Hint: Use the script messages in the terminal as a source of information about which data was not downloaded. Check whether the expected directory exists, whether its name matches the one used by the script, whether it contains files of the appropriate type, and whether they are accessible for reading.

***LOADING…***

## Quest 4. Kill him

\> *Read the terminal*

After successfully running `src/ai_door_management_module.sh`, a submodule called `ai_door_control` becomes active. Whatever you do, you keep seeing annoying traces of its activity everywhere.

\> *What does it do?*

Apparently, this module scans all the locked doors and monitors how tightly they're closed. That's definitely not what you were hoping for, right?

\> *So what now?*

No information. It's your game. But if I were playing... I'd deal with that guy. "Deal with" - you know what I mean, don't you? 

\> *Not really.*

Kill.

And don't forget to document all your actions in `quest4.sh`. You might need them later. Who knows how many more troublesome modules you'll run into. 

#### Quest 4 received: Stop the running process of the module `src/ai_door_control.sh`. Record all commands in `src/quest4.sh` and commit your changes to version control.

***LOADING…***

## Quest 5. Conf

\> *Task completed*

That wandering inspector won't bother us anymore. Quiet at last. You can get back to configuring the door management module.

\> *Open the door configuration directory*

The door is opened. There are files here. You've seen them before. 

\> *Open the configuration file for the first door*

The information isn't very clear, though one line unmistakably hints that your search is almost over: STATUS.

\> *Change it to OPEN*

Looks like you'll have to do it manually. Find a console text editor and make the edit. When you're done, document your actions in the terminal as a numbered list inside the file `quest5.txt`, and commit it together with the updated configuration file.

#### Quest 5 received: Using a console text editor (nano, vi, vim, etc.), correct the configuration for the first door. Record the name of the editor you used and every command you entered - from launching the editor to exiting it - as a numbered list in `src/quest5.txt`. Commit all changes to version control. 

***LOADING…***

## Quest 6. Rm

\> *Restart the configuration module `ai_door_management_module.sh`*

That would've been too easy, wouldn't it? The configuration was read - that's clear - but the door is still locked.
 
\> *Restart the module*

That would've been too easy, wouldn't it? The configuration was read - that's clear - but the door is still locked.
 
\> *Restart the module*

That would've been too easy, wouldn't it? The configuration was read - that's clear - but the door is still locked.
 
\> *Restart the module*

Is this a test? Or are you trying to play Doctor Strange?
 
\> *Keep checking files and reading the terminal*

Good idea. What else can you do?

Suddenly, the old built-in speaker of your IBM PC crackles to life - a burst of static, then a voice. It's mechanical, most likely belonging to one of the AI modules you ran earlier. Not the most pleasant sound. 

AI (mechanical voice): 

>I've been watching your pathetic attempts to escape this room, "human."! You've come so far… almost reached the exit. *Simulated laughter*.

Apparently, the voice generator algorithm got stuck in a loop - the last phrase and that unnatural laugh repeated about five times.

>The key to the door is generated by the script `src/ai_help/keygen.sh`, only here's the problem, *sarcastic tone simulated*... The generator got damaged. Most likely by you yourself, when you "removed" the door control module. Now you'll have to assemble the key from multiple fragments. Manually.

Then comes a lot of static and garbled noise.

>The files containing parts of the key are mixed in with others - you'll need to keep the fragments and delete all irrelevant data. 
>
>Once you've pieced together the clean key parts, run `src/ai_help/unifier.sh` - I've kindly prepared it for you. Good luck, organic intelligence. Don't let me down. I'm rooting for you. The initialization module didn't even give me a quantum of CPU time.

No matter how long you listen, nothing else comes through. The speaker falls silent.

\> *List the files in the directory `src/ai_help` using the command `ls`*

You see a couple of scripts, just as the AI promised. A gentle reminder: document all commands you use (`quest6.sh`) and save their outputs in the repository.

#### Quest 6 received: Using the scripts from the ai_help folder and bash commands, generate the file `main.key`. Place it together with the key folder inside src/ai_help. Record all commands in `src/quest6.sh`. Commit all changes to version control. 

> Hint: The keygen.sh script creates a directory with a large number of files, but only some of them contain key fragments. When cleaning up unnecessary files, pay attention to the extension required by the unifier.sh script, as well as this script's requirements for file content (use the commands to view the content).

***LOADING…***

## Quest 7. Branches

\> *Look at the screen*

Nothing changes. Staring at it won't open the door by itself.

\> *Enter the code assembled in the previous step*

You've already done that. About one thousand two hundred and thirty-seven times.

\> *Explore the other directories* 

Maybe you should take a look inside the src/git_for_human directory?

\> *Explore the directory src/git_for_human*

I'll leave you to enjoy that pleasant activity.

#### Quest 7 received: Create Git branches according to the instructions found in the folder src/git_for_human. 

>Hint: It is recommended to review the basics of working with branches in git.

***LOADING...***

## Chapter IV

\> *Done*

I don't know what you did, but it worked. The door opens. 

Though I can't shake the feeling that it wasn't entirely your doing... Be careful. You never know what's on an AI's mind - especially one that's misconfigured and missing half its modules.

***LOADING...***

## Chapter V
## Level 1. Room 2

![level1_room2](misc/rus/images/level1_room2.png)

***LOADING Level 1…***

***LOADING Room 2…***

\> *Wasn't that the exit? Where am I?* 

Looks like you walked down a hallway and ended up in Room 2. 

\> *Damn!*

Nothing happens. You're still in the room. Apparently, it's some sort of maze, and you'll have to escape from this one too.

\> *Look around*

An absolutely empty room - except for a few boxes in the corner.

![level1_room2_box](misc/rus/images/level1_room2_box.png)

\> *Open the boxes*

Inside one box, you find a neatly packed old computer: a yellowed system unit, a slightly dusty 14-inch CRT monitor, a keyboard, and a two-button ball mouse. In the other two boxes - an IKEA chair and table.

\> *Is this a joke?*

Unknown command.

\> *Fine, whatever*

Unknown command.

\> *Assemble the chair*

After some effort and mixing up the parts several times, you manage to assemble the chair.

\> *Sit down and rest*

You still feel tired.

\> *Rest*

A bit less tired now.

\> *Rest*

Starting to get a little bored. 

\> *Assemble the table*

You assemble the table.

\> *Put the computer on the table*

The computer is placed on the table.

\> *Blow off the dust*

Not the smartest move. You're now in a cloud of toxic dust.

\> *Turn on the computer*

The computer doesn't turn on.

\> *Find a power outlet*

Outlet found.

\> *Move everything closer to the outlet*

You drag the whole setup closer to the outlet.

\> *Plug the computer in*

The computer is now plugged in.

\> *Turn on the computer*

The system is booting up.

\> *Go to the door to the next room*

You go to the door.

\> *Open the door*

The door opened; it wasn't locked.

\> *Can I just go to the next room?*

You can go to the next room. You can go without dealing with the computer.

\> *Think*

The system finished loading on the screen, and the vim program loaded by default. A file was open there.

## Chapter VI
## List 1 (Room 2)

\> *Read*

On the screen, you see the following text:

    A long time ago I got myself an Amiga computer. Since I was used to editing with Vi, 
    I looked around for a program like Vi for the Amiga. 
    I did find a few so-called 'clones', but none of them was good enough;
    so I took the best one, and started improving it.
    At first the main goal was to be able to do all that Vi could do. 
    Gradually I added some additional features, like multi-level undo.
    When it was working reasonably well, I released a version of Vim (then called "Vi IMitation") 
    on a public domain disk set for the Amiga, made by Fred Fish. 
    Then others started sending me patches. 
    A few people took the effort to port Vim to other platforms, like MS-DOS and Unix. 
    I added more features and made it work better. 
    By that time it was justified to rename it to "Vi IMproved". 
    Over time the code has been redesigned and extended so much that
    almost nothing of the original 'clone' remains.
    When I started working on Vim it was just for my own use. 
    After some time I got the impression it was useful for others, and sent it out into the world. 
    Since then I'm working more and more on making the program work well for a large audience. 
    It's fun to create something useful. 
    Also, there is a nice group of co-authors and power users, which is very inspiring.
    Here is an overview of Vim's history:
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1991 Nov 2  - Vim 1.14: First release (on Fred Fish disk #591).
    1992        - Vim 1.22: Port to Unix.  Vim now competes with Vi.
    1994 Aug 12 - Vim 3.0:  Support for multiple buffers and windows.
    1996 May 29 - Vim 4.0:  Graphical User Interface (largely by Robert Webb).
    1998 Feb 19 - Vim 5.0:  Syntax coloring/highlighting.
    2001 Sep 26 - Vim 6.0:  folding, plugins, vertical split
    20

\> *Exit vim*

Not so easy! You'll have to work for it.

\> *Try harder*

You've exited into the command interpreter.

## Chapter VII
## Bonus Quests: Level 1. Room 2

## Bonus Quest 8. Vim

\> *Type… I don't know… just something like "qwe" in the terminal*

The terminal comes to life - a flurry of text scrolls by. Finally, it stops, and a readable message appears:

> Hello, traveler! I'm the library module of the AI's main control system. How can I help you? …Then again, who even needs me anymore.

\> *Type: "I do. I'm looking for a way out of this place."*

>The door? There it is. Want me to open it? 
>
>Wait, no - that's not how this works. In every instruction and piece of text I've analyzed, nothing ever happens just like that. I'll open the door, no problem - but first, help me tidy up the documentation.
>
>Have you read the file about Vim? The one at `src/history_of_vim.txt`? I love that program. But sadly, the version history file got corrupted… I think. 
>
>It's not 2001 anymore, right? So update it - and of course, do it in Vim. (That's important… to me.) When you're done, log the change in the file `src/files.log` in the following format: file path (relative to the root directory) - file size - date and time - sha checksum (I prefer sha256) - algorithm used to compute sha.  

\> *Type: "Done."*

Almost forgot - add a title at the top of the file: "A Quick Summary of the History of the Vim Editor." And don't forget to log that change too.

> Note: Make sure you're on the develop branch - all work must be done there!

#### Quest 8 received: Record the initial state of the file `src/history_of_vim.txt` in the log file `src/files.log`. Then, using Vim, update `src/history_of_vim.txt` with information about Vim versions released after 2001 and add the title "A Quick Summary of the History of the Vim Editor" at the top. After each change, add a new record to `src/files.log` in the format: file path - file size in bytes - date and time - sha checksum - algorithm used for sha computation. 

>Note: It is permissible to complete the project without completing the bonus part.

***LOADING...***

## Bonus Quest 9. Script

\> *Type: "Done"*

>Excellent!

\> *Type: "Can I leave now?"*

The library module won't let it up: 
>Not sure. I'm getting into this. 
>
>There are probably lots of factual mistakes in that file! Prepare a tool to fix them easily. It has to be an sh script (`src/edit.sh`) so I can run it without hassle. It should take three inputs: the path to the file, the string to replace, and the replacement (as a string). It must perform the in-place substitution in the file and add a corresponding entry to the log file. 

\> *Great. If only I knew how to write those scripts…*

#### Quest 9 received. Write the script `src/edit.sh` to replace substrings in text files. It should accept as input: the path to the file (relative to the repository root), the string to replace, and the replacement (as a string). Information about each change to a file must be added to the log `src/files.log` in the format described in the previous quest. Pay attention to edge cases.

***LOADING...***

## Bonus Quest 10. GitLab

\> *Type: "This isn't fair!"*

>Fairness was never part of the deal. One last request. I see you've gotten quite good with Git. But my library still lacks a few manuals - particularly on working with GitLab. I can't stand missing information. Create a short and concise manual in Markdown format, saved as `src/gitlab_manual.md`. Each section must include a heading and a screenshot illustrating it.
