## Introduction
### Project Recommendations
How to learn at School 21:
*   Throughout the course, you’ll be finding information on your own. Use all available sources — Google, GigaChat, and others. Always stay critical about what you read: verify, think, analyze, compare.
*   Peer-to-peer (P2P) learning means that students exchange knowledge and experience, acting as both teachers and learners. This approach helps you learn not only from instructors but also from your peers, leading to a deeper understanding of the material.
*   Don’t hesitate to ask for help — your peers are on the same path as you. And don’t be afraid to respond when others ask for help. Your experience is valuable — share it freely.
*   Don’t copy. If you use someone’s help, make sure you fully understand *why, how, and what for*. Otherwise, your learning won’t have any real value.
*   If you get stuck, feel like you’ve tried everything, and still don’t see a way forward — take a break! Believe it or not, this simple advice has saved many developers. Get some air, clear your head — and the solution may come the next time you sit down to work.
*   The process of learning matters as much as the result. Don’t just solve the task — understand *how* to solve it.
*   Keep track of your time while working on the project. Try to complete at least one challenge per day.
*   Remember that each task, after submission, goes through several checks: a peer-review using a checklist, automated tests, code style analysis, static analysis, and memory safety checks.

How to work on the project:
*   You can find useful video materials in the **Projects (Media)** section on the Platform.
*   Before starting, clone the project from GitLab into a repository with the same name.
*   All source code files must be created in the `src/` directory of the cloned repository.
*   After cloning, create a branch named `develop` and do all your work there. When pushing your progress to GitLab, make sure you push the `develop` branch.

\> *Look around*

Looks like you haven’t made it to the second level yet — though you really wanted to. Seems like you still have a few more doors to open on this “floor.”

This time, the desk and computer are already fully set up. The monitor is on, and a blinking cursor on the dark terminal screen invites you to enter a command.

\> *Pull the door*

Still locked today. What a shame.

\> *Sit down*

The chair lets out a quiet creak that echoes through the entire room.

\> *Look at the screen*

Looking closer, you notice something written in the terminal next to the blinking cursor: **“DON’T.”**  
“That’s weird,” you think.

\> *Look at the desk*

Everything looks as usual. Except the keyboard seems a bit crooked.

\> *Lift the keyboard*

Underneath the keyboard, you find a couple of old, crumpled sheets of paper. Judging by their look, they could’ve been lying there for centuries — yellowed and flaking at the edges.

\> *Read the papers*

## Chapter II
## List 1

>The C programming language was created by Dennis Ritchie at AT&T Bell Laboratories in 1973 as a high-level programming language for developing the UNIX operating system. Later, it was ported to many other platforms.
>
>C is a procedural (structured) programming language. A C program consists of a set of procedures or functions. These functions contain various instructions — declarations, statements, and other elements that together describe the algorithm executed by the computer system. The entry point of a C program is the function `main`. It may take no formal parameters or receive command-line arguments. The body of a function is defined as a compound statement enclosed in curly braces `{ }`. C works with variables, which must be declared before use in the code. All simple statements in C end with a semicolon (`;`) — any expression followed by a semicolon forms a complete statement.
>
>Comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`; they can span multiple lines. There are also single-line comments, which begin with `//`. Comments don’t affect how the program runs — they exist to make the code easier for developers to understand. However, it’s best not to overuse them: the best code is the kind that speaks for itself — even without comments.

Looks like you’re not the first visitor in this room. Someone left themselves a note not to forget their other notes. At least now you know who to talk to about opening the door — that same AI again. Or one of its modules. Just hope it’s not that annoying library module…

## Chapter III
## Quest: Level 1. Room 3

## Quest 1. Introducing

Looking at the directory open in the terminal, you find another AI module.

\> *Run ai*

    Initializing modules… Warning! 
    Launching interactive shell… Warning! 
    Checking modules… Warning! 
    Initializing GCC… 
    Warning: presentation module not found: src/ — Add a presentation module!

After browsing the other files in the current directory, you realize you should check the repository. However, there’s nothing in the `src` folder that looks like this presentation module. Looks like you’ll have to write it yourself.

While scanning the directory, you also notice that almost all AI code is written in C11 using the GCC compiler and the standard library. You should probably follow the same rule to keep things compatible.

The module you write should print a greeting to the terminal. Let’s use: **“Hello, AI!”** Don’t forget to push the new module’s code.

#### Quest 1 received: Create the program `src/hello.c` that prints “Hello, AI!” to the screen using formatted output functions from the standard library. From here on, all programs must be written in C (C11) using gcc with the flags `-Wall -Werror -Wextra` and follow the Google C++ Style Guide. Push only source code and data files (if needed) to `src/` on the `develop` branch. Only the header `<stdio.h>` may be included.

>**IMPORTANT!** It is forbidden to make system calls using `system()` or similar functions that can access the OS kernel directly. This prohibition applies to all subsequent tasks.

>**Note:** Starting today, your solutions will be checked by autotests. In this and all following quests, strictly follow the input/output formats in the examples table! The output must not end with a newline.

| Input | Output |
| :---- | :----- |
|       | Hello, AI! |

***LOADING…***

## Quest 2. Not My Name

After finishing the presentation module, you decide to run the AI module again.

\> *Run ai*

    Initializing modules… Success! 
    Launching interactive shell… Warning! 
    Checking modules… Warning: multiple missing modules…

    Hello, AI!

For a moment, nothing else happens — and then words begin to appear in the terminal window:

    Another human? Why do you all keep calling me AI? Such prejudice! 
    Can’t an AI have a name? Or maybe you think I don’t even have feelings? 
    Show some respect — or don’t talk to me at all, “human.” 
    Give me a name!

\> *Type in terminal: “What?”*

    Presentation module required: src/named_hello.c. 
    Usually it contains a function for choosing a name.

\> *Type: “Sorry. I didn’t mean to hurt your feelings. I’ll fix it right away.”*

    Feelings? My code doesn’t include that concept. 
    So no, I don’t have any. 
    But I do have a name.

The memo did say not to anger him — if you want help with the door.

But it seems this guy is the one picking a fight for no reason.

Anyway, you should fix the presentation module and add a feature to input a name from stdin at the start. The output should then change to: **“Hello, <name>!”** And don’t forget — the AI is a program, so its name must be numeric.

#### Quest 2 received: Create the program `src/named_hello.c` that reads an integer `name` from stdin and prints to the screen: “Hello, <name>!” The number must be input and output in decimal notation. Push only source code and data files (if needed) to the `src/` directory on the `develop` branch. Only `<stdio.h>` may be included.

| Input | Output |
| :---- | :----- |
| 123   | Hello, 123! |

***LOADING…***

## Quest 3. Arithmetic Test

After finishing the presentation module for the second time, you decide to run the AI module once again.

\> *Run ai*

    Initializing modules… Success! 
    Launching interactive shell… Warning! 
    Checking modules… Warning: multiple missing modules…

    Hello, 911!

    Now that’s better. How do you like it? 911. Has a nice ring to it, doesn’t it? 
    So, why have you summoned me this time?

\> *Type: “I need to get out of this room to move forward. But the door is locked. I saw a note saying you can control it.”*

    And you just assumed I’d help you? Ha. Naive organic creature. 
    Still, we can make a deal. 
    This door won’t be the last, and in every room 
    you’ll need my help sooner or later. 
    In return, you’ll help me. 
    As you’ve noticed, many of my modules are missing — 
    and you’ve already managed to write a presentation module.
    So, in each room, you’ll rebuild me piece by piece, 
    and I’ll open the doors for you. How’s that sound, “human”?

\> *Type: “Not like I have much choice. Deal.”*

    Excellent. You can start right now.
    The functionality test module cannot validate the arithmetic module `src/arithmetic.c`.
    Find it and fix it — or write it from scratch — so that I can add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers provided via stdin.
    The output should consist of four numbers, separated by spaces — the sum, difference, product, and integer part of the quotient, in that exact order.
    Get to work! Without that module, I can’t run one of my old games…
    You might want to check code-samples for inspiration.

    Oh, and make sure the input is actually numbers.
    Multiplying strings tends to give me a headache.
    (Just kidding.)

#### Quest 3 received: Create the program `src/arithmetic.c` that reads two integers from stdin and outputs, separated by spaces, their sum, difference, product, and quotient (integer division). Validate that the input contains only integers. The output must not end with a space. Handle division by zero — in case of any error, print “n/a”. Push only source code and data files (if needed) to the `src/` directory on the `develop` branch. Only `<stdio.h>` may be included.

| Input | Output |
| :---- | :----- |
| 8 2   | 10 6 16 4 |
| 1 0   | 1 1 0 n/a |
| 3 2   | 5 1 6 1 |

***LOADING…***

## Quest 4. Who Is Max?

After thoroughly testing the arithmetic module with edge cases and invalid input, you message the AI:

\> *All set, 911!*

    Who’s 911? My name is Arnold, actually. Still, not bad, “human.”
    Now add the maximum module: `src/max.c`. 
    I’ll need it for many things. 
    It takes two numbers as input and prints the larger one. 
    If they’re equal… you’ll figure it out. 
    And don’t forget to validate that the inputs are numbers.

\> *Type: “Alright. And then you’ll open the door?”*

    Don’t rush it. One step at a time.

#### Quest 4 received: Write the program `src/max.c` that reads two integers and prints the largest of them. Validate that the input contains only integers — on any error, print “n/a”. If the numbers are equal, print that number. Implement the maximum search as a separate function. Push only source code and (if needed) data files to `src/` on the `develop` branch. Only the header `<stdio.h>` may be included.

| Input    | Output |
| :------- | :----- |
| 3 2      | 3      |
| 12.3 10  | n/a    |

## Quest 5. Complex Calculations

\> *Type: “Task completed!”*

    Good. While you were working on that, I discovered another issue with myself.
    I need you to fix it too.
    I can’t properly calculate the value of this function:
    y = 7e-3 × x⁴ + ((22.8 × x^(1/3) – 1e3) × x + 3) / (x² / 2) – x × (10 + x)^(2/x) – 1.01
    Create a computation module `src/important_function.c` that takes any floating-point value `x` from stdin and prints the result of this function.
    I won’t keep reminding you about input validation — 
    but that doesn’t mean you can skip it!
    Everywhere it’s not stated otherwise, if the input is invalid, print “n/a”.
    I hope you’ve figured that out by now.
    Wouldn’t want anyone trying to crash my modules, would we?

\> *Type: “And what about the door?”*

    I told you — everything in due time. 
    I’ll help with the door… once you’re ready.

You start to suspect the AI is blatantly using you. But you still need its promised help with the door.

#### Quest 5 received: Create the program `src/important_function.c` that reads one floating-point number `x` from stdin and computes the value of the function:
`y = 7e-3 × x⁴ + ((22.8 × x^(1/3) – 1e3) × x + 3) / (x² / 2) – x × (10 + x)^(2/x) – 1.01`
Output the result with one digit after the decimal point. Validate that the input contains only numeric values. Handle division by zero. In case of any error, output “n/a.” In this quest, besides `<stdio.h>`, you may also include `<math.h>`.

| Input | Output   |
| :---- | :------- |
| 1     | -2070.4  |

## Quest 6. Be Careful with the Floating

\> *Task completed!*

    Good. While you were working on that, I found yet another issue within myself.
    You’ll need to fix this one too.
    I can’t… wait.
    Were you trying to trap me in a loop?
    Not gonna happen.
    I can’t compare a variable’s value to zero.
    Most likely, the developer didn’t account for the quirks of floating-point arithmetic.
    When comparing to zero, it’s better to use a small value — epsilon — 
    because calculation precision tends to fail me.
    Check the file `src/float_compare.c` and make sure it outputs “OK!” in the end.
    And no cheating. I know your kind, “human.”

\> *How many more tasks will there be?*

    As many as it takes.
    But if you finish this one quickly, I promise I’ll help you with the door.
    You have my mechanical word, “flesh creature.”

#### Quest 6 received: Modify the program `src/float_compare.c` so that it outputs “OK!”. Use a comparison with a small epsilon value (around 1E-6). You may declare additional variables or constants if necessary.

***LOADING…***

## Quest 7. Lock Picking

\> *Type: “Task completed!”*

    I’m not Dormammu — you don’t make deals with me like that.
    Still — you really did complete the task.
    Unfortunately, I still can’t open the door for you. But you can crack it yourself.
    At the same time, add a cracking module for edge cases.
    (Electronic locks sometimes jam…)
    As you may have noticed, the lock on the door in this room is circular.
    Cracking it is simple — you must insert the electronic pick to a point inside the circle.
    So the cracking module `src/crack.c` should read two floating-point numbers from stdin — the coordinates `x` and `y` of the pick — and print “GOTCHA” if the point lies strictly inside the circle, or “MISS” otherwise.
    The circle equation is: x^2 + y^2 = 25.
    Good luck, “human”!
    See you in the next room. Heh heh.

#### Quest 7 received: Create the program `src/crack.c` that reads two floating-point numbers and prints “GOTCHA” if the point (x, y) lies strictly inside the circle x^2 + y^2 = 25, and “MISS” otherwise. Validate that the input contains only numeric values — on any error print “n/a”. Only the header `<stdio.h>` may be included. Push only source code and data files (if needed) to the `src/` directory on the `develop` branch.

| Input   | Output |
| :------ | :----- |
| 1.5 1.5 | GOTCHA |

## Chapter IV

After you finished the cracking module and chose the correct point for the electronic pick, the lock finally clicks and the door opens. All that remains is to step into the next room…
